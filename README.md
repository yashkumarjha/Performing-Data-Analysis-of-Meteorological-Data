# Performing-Data-Analysis-of-Meteorological-Data
In this article, we will analyse and visualize the data from the weather data set of Finland, a country in the Northern Europe. The data set has hourly temperature recorded for last 10 years starting from 2006–04–01 00:00:00.000 +0200 to 2016–09–09 23:00:00.000 +0200. Now, let's start without thinking too much.
First let's start with downloading dataset and for that you can download the dataset either from Kaggle or Click here to download the dataset.
Now, I hope that everyone has downloaded the data set. So, we are going to use the numpy, pandas and the matplotlib libraries of Python.
Following is the hypothesis of the analysis :- "Has the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming."
Now, from this graph we can see a rise between the year 2008 and 2010 and there is a fall in temperature between the year 2014 and 2016. 
So, now we have come to a conclusion that global warming has caused an uncertainty in temperature over the past 10 years while the average humidity is remained as constant over the past 10 years.
